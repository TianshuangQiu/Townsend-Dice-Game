# Townsend-Dice-Game
A program to calculate the odds of winning in 3 moves or less in the odd game developed by Emily.

Roll 2 dice:

`if less than 3: gain 10 points`

`if 4: lose 10 points`

`if 5: get 5 points and roll again, if the second roll is greater than 5, gain 5 more points`

`if 6 or 7: lose 5 points`

`if you get 8 or 9: gain 15 points`

`if 10 or more: gain 10 points and roll again, if the second roll is 10, gain 10 more points`

`game ends when a player gets 45 points or more`
